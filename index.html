      I may utilize my expertise and allow the opportunity to grow and advance my skills. 
      I have a Bachelors degree in Art which allows me the ability to approch web design 
      with a creative mindset. I am a advid learner and dedicated team member. I have the ability to create
      excellent and functional code and to collaborate with cowokers on how to produce the best work.
       I spend most of time writing and learning 
      new ways to code through various programs such as Html, Css, java, node.js, and express.js. 
      When I am not coding I like to spend my spare time painting, skating, traveling and practicing martial arts.
      I enjoy meeting new people and learning new things. Im often inspired through learning different was of life and how people interact with one another.
       I don't take nothing in life for granted, for life is precious and so is our time. Because of this I strive to become a better person each and everyday.
